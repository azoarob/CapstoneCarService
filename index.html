        <h3>Your Guide To Surviving In Your Car This Winter…</h3>
        <p>When winter weather blows in, you needn't give driving the cold shoulder. But you might be wondering what to keep in your car in case of a winter breakdown. Read our checklist below to see how to build your own winter survival kit for your car...</p>
        <ul>
            <h3> 1. Ice Scraper and De-Icer </h3>
            <li> Ice scraper and de-icer - You never know when you'll wake up to an iced over windscreen or come back to a frozen car after a day out. Make sure you always carry an ice-scraper and de-icer so you can effectively defrost your windscreen. If you don't remove snow and ice properly, you could get 3 points on your licence and a £100 fine. </li>
            <h3> 2. Torch and spare batteries </h3>
            <li> Short days and long nights in winter mean you could be getting in and out of your car in the dark. Keep a torch handy to avoid any trips. If you break down, you'll need to find a safe place to wait for roadside assistance. A torch will help light your way on a dark verge.</li>
            <h3> 3. A Fully Charged Mobile Phone </h3>
            <li> If you're delayed because of bad weather (or a weather related incident), it's a good idea to let your loved ones know. It'll save them worrying and stop any distracting texts and phone calls coming in while you're behind the wheel. Just remember not to use a handheld phone while driving. Pull into a safe rest stop to make a call or ask a passenger to do it for you. If you install the AA app before you set off, you'll be able to easily plan a new route if there are diversions or call out a mechanic if you break down.</li>
        </ul>
